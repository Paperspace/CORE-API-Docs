# Node.js client

### Installation

#### Option 1: Download the pre-built 'paperspace' binary for your plaftorm <a id="option-1%3A-download-the-pre-built-&apos;paperspace&apos;-binary-for-your-plaftorm"></a>

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Paperspace/paperspace-node/releases) section to download the latest version of the paperspace CLI for Linux, Mac, and Windows.

After downloading, make sure the 'paperspace' binary is permitted to run on your system by marking its permissions appropriately. Also, add the directory containing the 'paperspace' binary to your path using a method appropriate for your platform.

#### Option 2: Install the paperspace-node package from npm <a id="option-2%3A-install-the-paperspace-node-package-from-npm"></a>

For this option you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8.12.0 or later. Check your Node.js version by running `node -v`. Node.js comes bundled with `npm`, the Node.js package management tool, which you'll use to install this package. Install the package using the -g option as follows:

```text
$ npm install -g paperspace-node
```

We recommend installing the paperspace-node package globally so that the `paperspace` command will be available on your command line everywhere on your system. If you want to make it available only within an individual Node.js project, you can install it for use only in the current directory by omitting the `-g` flag.
